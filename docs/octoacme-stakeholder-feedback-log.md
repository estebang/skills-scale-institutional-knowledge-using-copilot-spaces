# OctoAcme — Stakeholder Feedback Log

## Purpose
Track stakeholder feedback throughout the project lifecycle to ensure concerns are addressed and business needs remain aligned with project deliverables.

## When to use
- During project initiation to capture initial stakeholder input
- Throughout project execution to log ongoing feedback
- After demos and milestone reviews
- As part of retrospectives to review stakeholder engagement effectiveness

## Feedback Log Template

| Date | Stakeholder | Feedback/Concern | Category | Priority | Owner | Status | Resolution/Action |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|----------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Name/Group | Brief description | Feature/Risk/Process | High/Med/Low | Name | Open/In Progress/Resolved | Action taken or planned |

### Categories
- **Feature**: Feedback about functionality, requirements, or scope
- **Risk**: Concerns about potential risks or issues
- **Process**: Feedback about communication, timelines, or workflow
- **Usability**: Comments about user experience or design
- **Technical**: Technical constraints or architectural concerns

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Requires immediate attention, blocks progress or impacts business goals
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking, should be addressed in current iteration
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred to future iterations

## Best Practices
- Log feedback as soon as it's received to avoid losing context
- Assign an owner to each piece of feedback for follow-up
- Review feedback log in weekly PM syncs and update status
- Share feedback log with Stakeholder Advocate for tracking engagement
- Use feedback in sprint planning and retrospectives
- Close the loop with stakeholders by communicating resolutions
